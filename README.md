# Fortnite Mapper

Fortnite Mapper is an web based app that allows player to map challenges they need to complete in the game.  This allows players to plan their route to maximize the number of challenge they can complete in a single match, and level/tier up faster.

### Motivation

I enjoy playing Fortnite with my kids, but I don't have nearly as much time to play as they do.  For this reason I always have a ton of challenges to complete.  I try to make a plan, but I always get sidetracked and forget.  So, I decided to build this web app so that I can maximize my experience when I am playing, even if I do get sidetracked.
